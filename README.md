This project extracts data from an .out files that are generated by Mplus. The package is designed for simulation files that have the same naming convention with the rep number as part of the file name. 
There are three .out files in the Mplus folder that anyone can download to see what the output looks like. The files are analysis of a bifactor model with one general factor and two specific factors with
four items/indicators loaded to each specific factor. The model also has two latent classes. The output contains 250 variables, which are different measurements of the loadings.
